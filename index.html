        <li> <h3>I will Do Coding and Change The World</h3>
                <p>Coding has been changing the world since it was first invented. Back in 1883, the first program language was created. Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage were the first individuals who gave numbers a bigger importance than just numerical values. Together they created the Analytical Empire, which is believed to be the first ever primitive mechanical computer. Today there is an estimated total of 700 computer language programs that are used each and every other day.

        <p>My website will be the center of your digital eco-system, like a brick and mortar location, the experience matters once a customer enters, just as much as the perception they have of you before they walk through the door.</p>

        <li><h3>I will Do Coding and Change The World</h3>
            <p>I want to learn something. Writing or rewriting something in an unfamiliar language is a great way to learn it. Sometimes it isn’t a language; I’ve written a couple of web servers, a WebDAV implementation, a parser generator, a Smalltalk implementation, and so on.</p>

    <p class="suit">curse of the self-taught: fear that you know only points here and there, islands of knowledge, and between them are chasms into which you will fall in humiliating failure, a fear that followed me from the first time I learned how to code.</p>
